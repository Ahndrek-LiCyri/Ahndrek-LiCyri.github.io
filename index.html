		<p>Hey there! Sorry there have been such little updates to this site.</p>
		<p>Things have been very busy for me, and I am sorry for that.</p>
		<p>However, I feel like I should very much update the site, as it has been a very long time.</p>
		<p>The site is badly out of date in a lot of ways. So I will be "taking it down" for a bit while I work on the update.</p>
		<p>Thank you for your understanding! -Ahndrek</p>
