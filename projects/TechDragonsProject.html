			<p>Here is a quick Q&A about the mod.</p>
			<hr>
			<p>Q: <i>What was your inspiration for the mod?</i><br>
			A: Terraria, while being a mostly fantasy game, has hints and touches of Sci-Fi technology in it that most mods seem to miss or only barely expand upon.<br>
			This mods aims to close that gap a bit as well as add in some extra touches of Draconic influences for some extra excitement.<br>
			<br>
			Q: <i>Why is the Release Date only a estimate?</i><br>
			A: Due to college, I cannot guarentee a exact date for when it will come out. Please have patience!<br>
			<br>
			Q: <i>I wanna see more of the mod! Can you show more?</i><br>
			A: Well I'm glad you are excited for the mod and are wanting that bad to see more!<br>
			I will add more images and info to this web page as more in the mod is done. Please check back here occasionally to get updates and to stay up-to-date!</p>
